## Description:


An end-to-end application that shards your private key/secrets into multiple parts and sends it across to trusted human social accounts. 
Salient features include:

- Collusion resistance: This ensures that the shard-recievers (Guardians) don't generate user's private key without the permission/knowledge of the users.
- Implementation of modified Shamir secret algorithm(n,t): Shamir Secret algorithm forms the core of our system's logic.
- Providing a secure backup option as there is no single point of failure: Storing a private key in a single place, makes it very vulnerable to attacks. Sharding a private key and storing it in multiple places is a much more secure way to backup.

## Use-case:-
The authenticator apps currently in the market do not allow the user to reclaim the accounts if their account/phone/application is lost. Our authenticator app makes it possible to securely reclaim a 2fa-enabled account / Keys if the user loses their phone.
Share the account secrets among the userâ€™s friends/family

## The UX flow is:

- The user will enter the email addrs of the peers with which it wants to share the shard, and contact each one of them to approve the request.

- Once the user approves the requests, it's done.

- For Recovery (Upon data loss), the user can send recollect requests (hints of the peers are written in the SLDealer file) to the peers to get their share back.

- Once all the peers give the appropriate share back, the user can click on "Recover Key" to get all the accounts back!

## Challenges:

- Implementing Shamir's secret(collusion resistant) in JS.
- Extending (2,3) Sharding algorithm to (n,t).
